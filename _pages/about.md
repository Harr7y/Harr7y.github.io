Stay hungry, stay foolish.

I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) (EEE), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. and M.E. degree in the [School of Mechanical Engineering & Automation](http://www.me.buaa.edu.cn/) from [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/) in June 2018 and June 2021, respectively.

My current research interests include **Multi-modal generation** and **3D construction (GS)**ï¼Œadversarial robustness and backdoor attack. I also have research enthusiasm in AI-enabled robotic systems.

Welcome to contact me if you are interested in either of these topics!
